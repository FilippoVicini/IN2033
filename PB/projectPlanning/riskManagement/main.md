## What about
In this document you find all the things needed for project planning

## What Is risk management
We would consider risk as being 'something that many not go as planned. For example, a rick might be the computer with all your code on blowing up and thus you loose the entire code base.

We need to implement a scoring system for risk management. In addition, there is usually a maximum acceptable risk factor after mitigation that is permissible for the project to proceed.

### Assessing Risk
In the Team Project we will use the following scoring system:
- Severity/Impact
  - Negligible
  - Minor
  - Moderate
  - Critical
  - Catastrophic
- Likelihood
  - Rare
  - Unlikely
  - Moderate
  - Likely
  - Almost Certain
