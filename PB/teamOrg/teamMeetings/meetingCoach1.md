#  Coach Meeting 1

In this meeting we had a broad discussion with our coach describing how we setted up the project binder and showing how every participant in the team had an assigned role.
We also discussed how we are communicating with the other teams in order to develop effective specifications for database connections

We overall received positive feedback from the assessment and got some suggestions on further uml developments.
