# Tech stack
For this project we are building a desktop app with `java` `mysql` and `jdbc`

We will use the university servers in order to connect to other teams and host hour database live. In order to do this you must connect through the VPN provided by the university in order to connect to mysql. Once you are connect to the DB you can visit phpmyadmin at this url  https://sst-stuproj.city.ac.uk/phpmyadmin.

You will have to login with the credential provided by `Walter Martin` alternatively contact `Filippo Vicini` to get access to them.

The credentials will also be stored in an `.env` file that which is included in `.gitignore` so that they are not publicly available
