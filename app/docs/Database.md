# Tech stack
For this project we are building a desktop app with `java` `mysql` and `jdbc`

## Mysql setup
We can both use local databases or use the mysql server provided by the university. The latter will be setup using the vpn.
1. Install mysql on your machine
2. run `mysql -u root -p`
3. create a database
4. select the database and work with tables
