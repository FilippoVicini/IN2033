-Maintain Organized Project Documentation: Keep the project binder (stored under the PB subfolder in our repository) updated with the project plan, analysis/design diagrams, code documentation, testing reports, meeting notes, and risk registers.
-Adhere to Best Practices: Ensure every commit is made via a pull request, follows conventional commit guidelines, and is merged into the main branch only after careful review.

## Project Docs

The project Binder should contain:
- Project Plan
- Analysis diagrams
- Design diagrams
- Code documentation
- Testing scripts
- Testing reports
- Meeting notes and actions
- Communication with customer
- Risk register

The whole project binder will be contained in this repo under the `PB` sub folder. Everyone should focus in maintaining the structure clear and organized.
Everything should be stored in this repo. 

## Customer
The customer is `Lancaster's Music Hall` with the participation of other development groups we will particiapte in the creation of the final software. The venue uses paper based methods to manage the following processes:
- manage tickets
- booking shows
- ordering in films
- planning the calendar

The customer will like to automate several of these processes 

More can be found on the project binder 

## Being a good engineer
Everyone should have the goal to keep the structure in order. For the project to be successfull everyone must collaborate effectively.
Every commit should be a Pull Request (PR) which will then be merged into the main branch by the Team Leader more at (https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request)

Additionally we will use conventional commits to keep the structure of the whole system and keep track of commits. Please follow the conventional commits guide at (https://www.develer.com/en/blog/git-how-to-write-commits-and-why/). Examples can be found (https://github.com/SerenityOS/serenity) and (https://github.com/angular/angular/commits/main/) 

Every commit that is not in line with the guidelines of the project will not be accepted.
